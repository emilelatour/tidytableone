\description{
A nearly identical data set found in appendix D of Fleming and Harrington.

The data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of
the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984. A total of 424 PBC patients,
referred to Mayo Clinic during that ten-year interval, met eligibility
criteria for the randomized placebo controlled trial of the drug
D-penicillamine. The first 312 cases in the data set participated in the
randomized trial and contain largely complete data. The additional 112 cases
did not participate in the clinical trial, but consented to have basic
measurements recorded and to be followed for survival. Six of those cases
were lost to follow-up shortly after diagnosis, so the data here are on an
additional 106 cases as well as the 312 randomized participants.
